# SBIC
Sequential Biclustering for gene expression data

This is the first working version of SBIC() that collects all scripts for relevant functions.
The pipeline will work thoroughly, including the following components:

1. A function doing sequential biclustering.
2. A general function of differential expression analysis.
3. A function for fitting classification tree and cross validation.
4. Other necessary functions such as heatmap creating, and user-friendly prediction.

This project aims at building a comprehensive analysis pipeline to identify immune evasion subtypes (IES) of cancer patients, 
using sequential biclustering procedure to gene expression datasets. The underlying biological mechanism of each IES will 
also be carefully investigated on both gene level and pathway level. A classification tree will be fitted to identify important
classifier genes of each IES. The whole pipeline will practically shed light to the selection of combination immunotherapies.
